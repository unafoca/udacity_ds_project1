## Installation
In order to run the codes successfully, besides the Anaconda distribution of Python, you'll need to install below packages:<br/>

* nltk
* seaborn
* dataframe_image <br/>

After that he code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation
For this project, I was interestested in using the latest available data (Apr'21) for NYC from Inside Airbnb website to better understand:

1. What's the distribution of listings within NYC?
2. How much more should you expected to pay if you want to sleep in Manhattan and is it worth it?
3. When do people usually visit NYC?
4. What are the most used words by the hosts when describing their properties in NYC?

The analysis is published in Medium [here](https://cq-w.medium.com/travelers-to-the-big-apple-14e3221f3f0b).
## File Descriptions
There is one notebook for the codes used to perform the analysis and 3 csv files downloaded from Inside Airbnb as the data sources. Other pictures are output from the codes and are used in the published analysis for demonstration purposes.

##Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements
Thanks to Inside Airbnb for the data. The analysis won't be possible otherwise. You can find the descriptive information and data for other cities [here](http://insideairbnb.com/about.html).
